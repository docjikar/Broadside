# Broadside
A Dice Game

Broadside is a combative dice game between two players. In this instance, a dice game between one player and a computer player. The end goal of this project is to have a fully multiplayer game with the option to play against the computer as an android app.

The game is played by rolling four dice and initially arranging them highest to lowest. With lowest being on the bottom. If there are any matches, the runner is rolled (the runner starts out as the lowest value but can be any dice roll after). The runner can then be swapped out with another die in the boat, the other three dice in the boat are always re-arranged highest to lowest with the runner being excluded from the sort. Play continues until there are no more matches (6's and 5's don't count). The lowest score wins and is counted towards the total. There are always 14 rounds played. If a player wins more than 7 matches, their lowest score is passed to the other players total. Boat score totals that are equivalent result in a rolloff. Even if the boats are full of 5's and/or 6's. In the case of a rolloff, the player with the highest valued runner wins the score towards their total.
